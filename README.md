       <head> <P> I am a person who enjoys programming sometimes per say I have realised that it is possible to write ones own language using the code of old. that is where all the others have come from anyway someone once said what ever I have done I have been standing on other peoples sholders. And It seems that is exactly what computer programming is standing on each others sholders </P>
         <!PHP> "all I am really intrested in is finding a place in this world and adding something to the future"
          <p> seems I really need to get down to it and drum certian symbols into my head kinda sick and tired of it some times though I have learned many of these symbols before then I had to move on to something else which distracted me. I do not mind starting from scratch if I thought the same was not going to happen again I live with me ma and pa have no money which I really do not care to much for anyway just enougth to keep warm, dry, fed, watered and enougth to keep me able to buy hardware and internet connection. I would love to explore the world well of the tourist track but the connection and data are the main things I or we need to create some software that is useful to somebody I hate it when organisations get paid millions of dollers and the program does not work in the end anyway I would like to think I would give the money back minus expence and like mentioned anougth to keep me going any how that is my intro readme file not the first and sure it will not be the last </p> == >0< " ' "
